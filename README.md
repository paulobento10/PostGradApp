# PostGradApp
This is my final project of my computer engineering course, this is an app that allows the teacher to manage post graduations students.
It is useful for both students that are foreign and local.
It was made using primarily php to the back-end side of the app, css, html and javascript to the front-end side. For the database, it is used MySql for relacional data, such as id, names, email, etc. MongoDB is used to store documents, and Memcached is used to store secret codes to register during some time and as a caching mechanism. The page is also responsive, and very simple to use.
